# 01-Excel-Homework

The excel challenge that was presented to us was to perform a series of excel formulas and commands taught during the first week of my Data Analytics bootcamp. The dataset comprised of about 4000 Kickstarter campaigns and we were told to dissect the factors that led to a campaign's success.

A series of pivot tables were created to show trends and conclusions that can be drawn from the result. Further analysis and explanations can be found in the accompanied report.
